---

## ‚ùå What's MISSING (Critical Gaps for Full Service)

### Phase 3: Bulk Roster Management & CSV Import (‚ùå 0% Complete)

**Missing Features:**
1. **CSV Upload UI Component**
   - File upload dropzone
   - CSV format template download
   - Preview table before import
   - Progress indicator during upload

2. **CSV Parser & Validator**
   - Parse CSV file on client or server
   - Validate required fields (name, sub_team)
   - Email validation (optional field)
   - Size validation (S, M, L, XL, XXL)
   - Jersey number uniqueness check

3. **Bulk Import API Endpoint**
   - `POST /api/institutions/[slug]/programs/[programId]/import-roster`
   - Process CSV rows
   - Create `institution_sub_team_members` records
   - Return import summary (success/failed counts, errors)
   - Rollback on critical errors

4. **Import Summary Modal**
   - Show imported count
   - Show skipped count
   - Display validation errors
   - Allow retry for failed rows

**Why Critical:**
Without CSV import, Athletic Directors must manually add 50-300 players ONE BY ONE, which is completely impractical for institutions. This is a **blocker for real-world adoption**.

**Estimated Development Time:** 1 week

---

### Phase 4: Order Management & Budget Tracking (üü° 30% Complete)

**What Exists:**
- ‚úÖ Orders API endpoint with filtering
- ‚úÖ Orders table UI component
- ‚úÖ Basic order creation (but not institution-specific)

**Missing Features:**

#### 4.1 Institution-Specific Order Creation Wizard (‚ùå 0% Complete)
**Current Issue:** Order creation wizard is designed for small teams. Doesn't include program/sub-team selection or budget allocation.

**Needs:**
- **Step 1:** Select program and sub-team
- **Step 2:** Select approved design for that sport
- **Step 3:** Auto-load players from sub-team roster (not from user accounts)
- **Step 4:** Assign sizes to each player
- **Step 5:** Review total cost and assign budget allocation

**API Endpoint Needed:**
- `POST /api/institutions/[slug]/orders` - Create order with `program_id`, `sub_team_id`, `budget_allocation_id`

#### 4.2 Budget Allocation System (‚ùå 0% Complete)
**Missing Tables:**
The implementation **simplified** the original plan. The `institution_programs` table was **NOT created**. Instead, `institution_sub_teams` serves as both programs AND sub-teams.

**This causes a problem:** There's no dedicated budget per PROGRAM (e.g., "Football Program Budget: $12,000"). Budget would need to be tracked at institution level or sub-team level.

**Options to Fix:**
1. **Add budget fields to `institution_sub_teams`** - Simple but less flexible
2. **Create `institution_programs` table** - Matches original plan, more robust
3. **Track budget in `teams` table only** - Institution-wide budget, no per-program tracking

**Recommendation:** Create `institution_programs` table as originally planned for proper budget hierarchy.

**Missing Features:**
- Budget allocation when creating orders
- Budget validation (prevent over-allocation)
- `institution_budget_allocations` table
- Budget deduction from program budget
- Budget remaining calculations

#### 4.3 Finance Dashboard (‚ùå 0% Complete)
**File Needed:** `/src/app/mi-equipo/[slug]/finance/page.tsx`

**Missing Features:**
- Institution-wide budget overview
- Budget by program table
- Allocated vs. Spent vs. Remaining progress bars
- Transaction history
- Budget adjustment modal
- CSV/PDF export

**API Endpoints Needed:**
- `GET /api/institutions/[slug]/finance/overview` - Finance dashboard data
- `GET /api/institutions/[slug]/finance/transactions` - Transaction history
- `PATCH /api/institutions/[slug]/finance/adjust-budgets` - Update program budgets

**Why Critical:**
Athletic Directors need to know how much budget is allocated, spent, and remaining across all programs. This is **essential for financial planning and compliance**.

**Estimated Development Time:** 2 weeks

---

### Phase 5: Communication & Announcements (‚ùå 0% Complete)

**Missing Features:**

#### 5.1 Announcement System (‚ùå 0% Complete)
**Missing Tables:**
- `institution_announcements` - Stores announcements
- `institution_announcement_reads` - Tracks who read each announcement

**Missing API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/institutions/[slug]/announcements` - Create announcement
- `GET /api/institutions/[slug]/announcements` - List announcements for user
- `PATCH /api/institutions/[slug]/announcements/[id]/read` - Mark as read

**Missing UI Components:**
- Announcement creation modal
- Audience targeting UI (all, specific program, specific sub-team)
- Email send checkbox
- Announcement feed/notification center
- Unread count badge

#### 5.2 Email Integration (‚ùå 0% Complete)
**Missing:**
- Email service integration (Resend, SendGrid, etc.)
- Email templates for announcements
- Email queue system
- Email sending logic in announcement creation

**Why Critical:**
Athletic Directors need to communicate with coaches and coordinators about schedule changes, order updates, and important announcements. Currently **no way to broadcast messages** institution-wide or to specific programs.

**Estimated Development Time:** 1.5 weeks

---

### Phase 6: Reporting & Analytics (‚ùå 0% Complete)

**Missing Features:**

#### 6.1 CSV Exports (‚ùå 0% Complete)
**Needed Exports:**
- Orders CSV (all orders with filters)
- Member roster CSV (all players across all programs)
- Financial report CSV (budget allocations and spending)

**API Endpoints Needed:**
- `GET /api/institutions/[slug]/reports/orders?format=csv`
- `GET /api/institutions/[slug]/reports/members?format=csv`
- `GET /api/institutions/[slug]/reports/finance?format=csv`

#### 6.2 Analytics Dashboard (‚ùå 0% Complete)
**Missing Charts:**
- Orders over time (line chart)
- Spending by program (pie chart)
- Member growth over time (line chart)
- Top products ordered (bar chart)

#### 6.3 PDF Reports (‚ùå 0% Complete)
**Needed:**
- Financial report PDF generation
- Order summary PDF
- Roster PDF for printing

**Why Critical:**
Athletic Directors need to provide reports to principals, superintendents, and school boards. **CSV and PDF exports are mandatory** for compliance and auditing.

**Estimated Development Time:** 1.5 weeks

---

### Phase 7: Testing & Refinement (‚ùå 0% Complete)

**Missing:**
- End-to-end testing of all institution features
- RLS policy testing with different roles
- Performance testing with large datasets (500+ members, 100+ orders)
- UI/UX refinement based on user feedback
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- User guide documentation

**Estimated Development Time:** 1 week

2. ‚úÖ **Budget Management System** (Sprints 2-3) - Essential for financial control
3. ‚úÖ **Institution Order Creation** (Sprint 4) - Required for placing orders
4. ‚úÖ **Communication System** (Sprint 5) - Important for operations
5. ‚úÖ **Reporting & Exports** (Sprint 7) - Required for compliance

### Recommended Action Plan
1. **Start Sprint 1 (Bulk CSV Import) immediately** - This is the #1 blocker
2. **Weeks 2-3:** Implement budget management (foundation + dashboard)
3. **Week 4:** Implement institution order creation
4. **Week 5:** Implement communication system
5. **Weeks 6-7:** Add program detail pages and reporting

**After these 7 sprints, you will have a production-ready institution dashboard that provides full service to Athletic Directors.**
