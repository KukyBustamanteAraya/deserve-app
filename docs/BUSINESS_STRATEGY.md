## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

**1. Single Team Orders**
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: $350,000 CLP (~$400 USD)
- **Typical Order**: 12 players × $25,000 CLP jersey + $15,000 CLP shorts = $480,000 CLP
- **Margin**: 40-50% gross margin
- **Payment Model**: Split payments (players pay individually) or manager pays all

**2. Institution Orders**
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: $4,500,000 CLP (~$5,000 USD)
- **Typical Institution**: 10 sports × 15 players × $30,000 CLP/unit = $4,500,000 CLP
- **Margin**: 35-45% gross margin (bulk discount applied)
- **Payment Model**: Centralized (Athletic Director pays) or distributed (coaches pay per program)

**3. Recurring Revenue** (Future)
- Seasonal reorders (jerseys every 2 years)
- Replacement player kits
- New program additions
- Fan gear extensions

### Pricing Strategy

**Dynamic Pricing Tiers**:
- **1-15 units**: Base price (e.g., $40,000 CLP per jersey)
- **16-30 units**: 12.5% discount ($35,000 CLP per jersey)
- **31-50 units**: 20% discount ($32,000 CLP per jersey)
- **51+ units**: 25% discount ($30,000 CLP per jersey)

**Why This Works**:
- Encourages larger orders without excluding small teams
- Institutions automatically get better pricing
- Clear, predictable cost structure
