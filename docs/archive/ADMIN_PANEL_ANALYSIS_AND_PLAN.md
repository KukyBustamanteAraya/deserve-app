### üèóÔ∏è Existing Admin Architecture

#### **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Location:** `src/lib/auth/admin-guard.ts`
- **Method:** `requireAdmin()` function
- **Security:** Role-based access control via `profiles.role === 'admin'`
- **Flow:**
  1. Check authenticated user via Supabase Auth
  2. Query `profiles` table for admin role
  3. Redirect non-admins to `/dashboard?error=admin_required`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Solid, production-ready

#### **Admin Layout & Navigation**
- **Location:** `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` + `AdminNav.tsx`

## üîí PART 5: SECURITY & PERMISSIONS

### Row Level Security (RLS)
**Already implemented** in Phase A schema:
- Public can read active designs
- Admins can manage all designs
- Same for design_mockups and design_products

### API Authorization
**All admin API routes must:**
```typescript
import { requireAdmin } from '@/lib/auth/admin-guard';

export async function GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE(request: Request) {
  await requireAdmin(); // Throws and redirects if not admin
  // ... rest of logic
}
```

### File Upload Security
**Supabase Storage buckets:**
- `designs` bucket (already exists or create)
- Policies:
  - Public read for active designs
  - Admin-only write
- File validation: PNG, JPG, WEBP only, max 5MB

## üìù PART 8: QUESTIONS FOR USER

Before starting implementation, please clarify:

### **1. Design Upload Workflow**
**Q:** Who will be uploading designs? Just you (admin) or will there be external designers?
- If external: Need a designer role and approval workflow
- If just admin: Simpler, direct creation

### **2. Mockup Image Source**
**Q:** How will mockup images be created?
- Manual upload (JPG/PNG files)
- Generated automatically from templates?
- Integration with design software (Figma, Adobe)?
- 3D rendering service?

### **3. Design Ownership**
**Q:** Should designs have an owner/creator field?
- Track which admin created the design?
- External designer attribution?
- Royalty tracking?

### **4. Design Approval Process**
**Q:** Do designs need approval before going live?
- Draft ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Approved ‚Üí Active workflow?
- Or admin creates and publishes directly?

### **5. Product Compatibility**
**Q:** When creating a design, should we:
- Auto-link to ALL products? (then admin removes incompatible)
- Start with ZERO products? (admin manually adds compatible products)
- Suggest compatible products based on sport?

### **6. Mockup Requirements**
**Q:** Minimum mockup requirements before publishing?
- Require at least 1 mockup per sport?
- Require front AND back views?
- Or allow publishing with any mockup count?

### **7. Bulk Operations Priority**
**Q:** Which bulk operation is most important to you?
- Bulk mockup upload (50 images at once)?
- Bulk design-product linking (link 1 design to 20 products)?
- Bulk design status change?
- Bulk export?

### **8. Design Versioning**
**Q:** Do you need to track design changes over time?
- Simple (last updated timestamp)?
- Full versioning (history of changes)?
- Not needed for MVP?

### **9. Custom Fields**
**Q:** Any other design metadata you need?
- SKU/Item numbers?
- Cost data?
- Supplier information?
- Fabric recommendations?

### **10. Integration Priorities**
**Q:** Which section should we integrate with designs first?
- Products (show designs in product management)?
- Design Requests (let users request existing designs)?
- Orders (show which design was ordered)?
- All equally important?
