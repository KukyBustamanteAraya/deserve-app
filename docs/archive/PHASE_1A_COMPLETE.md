  - Filters: search, status (active/inactive), featured, sport, sort
  - Returns transformed data with mockup counts and available sports/products
- `POST` - Create new design
  - Validates name and slug uniqueness

## Testing Checklist

### Before Testing - Required Setup

#### ⚠️ Create Supabase Storage Bucket
The form uploads mockup images to Supabase Storage bucket named `designs`.

**Steps to create:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Create new bucket: `designs`
3. Set to Public (so mockup URLs are accessible)
4. Create folder structure (optional):
   - `design-mockups/` (form automatically creates subfolders per design)

**RLS Policies for Storage:**
```sql
-- Allow authenticated admins to upload
CREATE POLICY "Admins can upload mockups"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'designs' AND
  (auth.jwt()->>'role')::text = 'admin'
);

-- Allow authenticated admins to delete
CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete mockups"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'designs' AND
  (auth.jwt()->>'role')::text = 'admin'
);

-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public can view mockups"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'designs');
```

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Phase 1B - Bulk Upload Wizard
- Not yet implemented
- Will allow CSV + ZIP upload for multiple designs at once
- Manual naming for each design during upload

### Phase 2 - Frontend Catalog
- Catalog pages not yet implemented
- Netflix-style horizontal rows
- Filter by sport/product type
- Database function `get_designs_for_sport_product` needs to be created

### Phase 3 - Integration & Polish
- Analytics integration
- Product type pricing management
- Performance optimization
- Error tracking
