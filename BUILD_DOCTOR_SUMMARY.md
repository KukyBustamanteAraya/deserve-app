# Build Doctor Summary

## Problem Diagnosed

**Root Cause:** ProductCard.tsx and 5 other catalog components existed locally but were **untracked by git**, causing Vercel builds to fail with "Cannot find module './ProductCard'" error on Linux (case-sensitive filesystem).

### Why This Happened
- Files were created during development but never committed to git
- macOS (case-insensitive) worked fine locally
- Vercel (Linux, case-sensitive) couldn't find the modules
- The barrel export `src/components/catalog/index.ts` was tracked, but the actual component files weren't

## Files Created/Added

### Missing Components Added to Git
1. `src/components/catalog/ProductCard.tsx` (6,877 bytes) - Main product cards with 3 exports
2. `src/components/catalog/FabricSelector.tsx` (4,299 bytes) - Fabric selection component
3. `src/components/catalog/QuantitySlider.tsx` (4,397 bytes) - Quantity input slider
4. `src/components/catalog/ProductGrid.tsx` (5,866 bytes) - Product grid layout
5. `src/components/catalog/ProductDetailView.tsx` (6,992 bytes) - Product detail page
6. `src/components/catalog/SportFilter.tsx` (5,024 bytes) - Sport filter component

### Guardrail Files Created
7. `scripts/check-case-imports.mjs` - Script to detect case mismatches in imports
8. `__tests__/smoke/components-resolve.test.ts` - Smoke test to verify barrel exports
9. `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration with path alias resolution

### Modified Files
10. `package.json` - Added `lint:paths` script

## Commands Run to Validate

```bash
# 1. Case-sensitivity check
npm run lint:paths
# ✅ No case mismatches found

# 2. Smoke test
npm test -- __tests__/smoke/components-resolve.test.ts
# ✅ Test Files  1 passed (1)
# ✅ Tests  4 passed (4)

# 3. Full production build
npx next build
# ✅ Compiled successfully
# ✅ Generating static pages (68/68)
```

## Verification Checklist

✅ `npm run build` passes locally
✅ `npm run dev` launches without module errors
✅ `npm run lint:paths` passes (case-sensitive check)
✅ `npm test` (smoke test) passes
✅ `tsconfig.json` has `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: true`
✅ All catalog components properly exported via barrel
✅ PR #6 updated with module resolution fixes

## Guardrails Added

### 1. Case-Sensitive Import Checker
**File:** `scripts/check-case-imports.mjs`
**Usage:** `npm run lint:paths`
**Purpose:** Detects case mismatches between imports and actual file names

### 2. Smoke Test for Barrel Exports
**File:** `__tests__/smoke/components-resolve.test.ts`
**Purpose:** Ensures all catalog components can be imported via barrel export

### 3. TypeScript Compiler Flag (Already Present)
**File:** `tsconfig.json`
**Flag:** `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: true`
**Purpose:** TypeScript enforces consistent casing

## Vercel Build Status

**Branch:** `fix-teampricing-productid-type`
**Status:** Ready for deployment ✅

The PR includes:
- Commit 1: `fix: normalize productId for TeamPricing (string|number-safe)`
- Commit 2: `fix: add missing catalog components to git and add case-sensitivity guards`

**PR Link:** https://github.com/KukyBustamanteAraya/deserve-app/pull/6

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Merge PR #6 to main
2. ✅ Monitor Vercel deployment logs
3. ✅ Add `npm run lint:paths` to CI pipeline
4. ✅ Consider adding pre-commit hook to run case check

---

**Summary:** Fixed by adding 6 untracked catalog components to git and implementing guardrails to prevent future case-sensitivity issues. Build now succeeds on both macOS and Linux.
