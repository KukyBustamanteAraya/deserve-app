## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES & BUG FIXES

### üö® HIGH PRIORITY: Payment Progress Dashboard Race Condition

**Issue**: Payment shows as successful on Mercado Pago, but when user returns to team page, it doesn't reflect that their payment was approved.

**Root Cause**: Race condition between user redirect and webhook processing
1. User completes payment on Mercado Pago ‚úÖ
2. User redirected to `/payment/success?external_reference=...` ‚úÖ
3. Success page shows "successful" message immediately ‚úÖ
4. After ~5 seconds, redirects to team page ‚úÖ
5. **BUT**: Mercado Pago webhook is async and may take 5-30 seconds to arrive ‚ùå
6. When user lands on team page, `payment_contribution.payment_status` is still `"pending"` instead of `"approved"` ‚ùå

**Solution**: Implement polling on success page to wait for webhook confirmation

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/app/payment/success/page.tsx` - Add polling logic that:
  1. Fetches payment status every 3 seconds via `/api/payment-contributions/[externalRef]`
  2. Checks if `paymentStatus === 'approved'`
  3. Only redirects to team page once payment is confirmed
  4. Timeout after 60 seconds with helpful message
  5. Update redirect to go to `/mi-equipo/[slug]/payments` instead of just `/mi-equipo/[slug]`

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add polling interval to success page useEffect
2. Poll `/api/payment-contributions/[externalRef]` every 3 seconds
3. Check `data.paymentStatus === 'approved'`
4. Clear interval and redirect once approved
5. Add timeout logic (20 attempts * 3 seconds = 60 seconds max)
6. Show message if timeout: "El pago est√° siendo procesado. Por favor, verifica el estado en tu equipo en unos minutos."

**Priority**: HIGH - This affects user perception of payment success

---

## üéØ ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

### ‚úÖ STATUS: All major phases complete! Only bug fixes remaining.

---

## **ARCHIVE: COMPLETED PHASES**

The following sections document completed work for reference.

---

## **PHASE A: DESIGN VS PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: Current system conflates designs (visual patterns) with products (physical items). This architectural fix enables:
- Product-first navigation (users browse jerseys, then see designs)
- Cross-sport design flexibility (soccer design on basketball jersey)
- Scalable content strategy (products set once, designs added continuously)
- Admin efficiency (upload soccer mockup, add basketball later)

**Reference Document**: `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN_VS_PRODUCT.md`

### A.1: Database Schema Migration (Week 1)

**Goal**: Create new tables separating designs from products

**Migration File**: `069_design_product_separation.sql`

```sql
-- üé® DESIGNS TABLE (pure visual patterns)
CREATE TABLE designs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  designer_name TEXT,
  style_tags TEXT[],           -- ["modern", "classic", "geometric"]
  color_scheme TEXT[],          -- ["blue", "red", "white"]
  is_customizable BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  allows_recoloring BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- üñºÔ∏è DESIGN MOCKUPS (how design looks on sport+product combinations)
CREATE TABLE design_mockups (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  design_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES designs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sport_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES sports(id),
  product_type_slug TEXT NOT NULL,          -- "jersey", "shorts", "hoodie"
  mockup_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  view_angle TEXT,                          -- "front", "back", "side"
  is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  sort_order INT DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),

  UNIQUE(design_id, sport_id, product_type_slug, view_angle)
);

-- üëï PRODUCTS TABLE (restructured - remove design fields)
-- MODIFY existing products table to be pure product catalog
ALTER TABLE products DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS images;
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS product_type_name TEXT;
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sort_order INT DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE products ADD CONSTRAINT unique_sport_product_type
  UNIQUE(sport_id, product_type_slug);

-- üé®üëï JUNCTION TABLE (which designs work on which products)
CREATE TABLE design_products (
  design_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES designs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  product_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  is_recommended BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  preview_mockup_id UUID REFERENCES design_mockups(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (design_id, product_id)
);

-- üìù UPDATE DESIGN REQUESTS
ALTER TABLE design_requests ADD COLUMN design_id UUID REFERENCES designs(id);
-- Note: Keep product_id as-is for now, will migrate data

-- üì¶ UPDATE ORDER ITEMS
ALTER TABLE order_items ADD COLUMN design_id UUID REFERENCES designs(id);
-- Note: product_id already exists, will migrate references
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create migration file with schema changes
- [ ] Add indexes on new tables
- [ ] Add RLS policies for designs and design_mockups
- [ ] Create updated_at triggers
- [ ] Test migration in development environment
- [ ] Verify no breaking changes to existing orders

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Migration runs without errors
- [ ] Existing orders/products still accessible
- [ ] Can insert test design
- [ ] Can insert test design_mockup
- [ ] RLS policies prevent unauthorized access

---

### A.2: Data Migration & Backfill (Week 1-2)

**Goal**: Migrate existing product data to new structure without data loss

**Migration File**: `070_backfill_designs_from_products.sql`

**Strategy**:
1. Extract unique designs from existing products table
2. Create design records
3. Create design_mockups from product images
4. Link existing design_requests to new design_id
5. Link existing order_items to new design_id

**Script**:
```sql
-- Step 1: Create designs from existing products
-- Identify unique designs (products with same base attributes but different sports)
-- This will require manual review and mapping

-- Step 2: Create design_mockups
-- Map existing product.images ‚Üí design_mockups table

-- Step 3: Update design_requests
UPDATE design_requests dr
SET design_id = (
  SELECT d.id FROM designs d
  WHERE d.slug = dr.product_slug  -- Mapping logic TBD
)
WHERE design_id IS NULL;

-- Step 4: Update order_items
UPDATE order_items oi
SET design_id = (
  SELECT d.id FROM designs d
  JOIN products p ON p.id = oi.product_id
  WHERE d.slug = p.slug  -- Mapping logic TBD
)
WHERE design_id IS NULL;
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Audit existing products table
- [ ] Identify unique designs vs products
- [ ] Create mapping document (old product_id ‚Üí new design_id)
- [ ] Write backfill migration
- [ ] Test migration on development data
- [ ] Verify data integrity after migration
- [ ] Document any manual interventions required

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] All existing orders have design_id
- [ ] All existing design_requests have design_id
- [ ] No orphaned records
- [ ] Product prices preserved
- [ ] Image URLs migrated correctly

### B.4: Manager Approves Design (Triggers Order Creation) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented and tested

**Completed**: 2025-10-11

**Goal**: Manager approves final design, system automatically creates order

**Critical Flow**: This is when orders get created!

**Status Change**: `ready_for_voting` ‚Üí `approved`

**What Was Built**:
- ‚úÖ Design approval modal with payment mode selection
- ‚úÖ API endpoint `/api/design-requests/[id]/approve`
- ‚úÖ Automatic order creation with order_items for all team members
- ‚úÖ Payment mode selection (individual vs manager_pays_all)
- ‚úÖ Save as team default option
- ‚úÖ Links design_request.order_id to new order
- ‚úÖ Chilean Peso (CLP) formatting fixed (no division by 100)
- ‚úÖ Mercado Pago payment amount fix (sends correct CLP amounts)
- ‚úÖ RLS policies for orders, order_items, and payment_contributions
- ‚úÖ Player payment view in `/mi-equipo/[slug]/payments`
- ‚úÖ Manager payment controls
- ‚úÖ Real-time payment progress display

**Bug Fixes**:
- ‚úÖ Fixed `formatCLP()` - removed incorrect division by 100
- ‚úÖ Fixed MercadoPago preference creation - removed incorrect division by 100
- ‚úÖ Fixed generated columns (total_cents, line_total_cents) - removed from inserts
- ‚úÖ Dropped broken database trigger `order_items_calculate_total`
- ‚úÖ Added RLS policies allowing team members to view orders

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/team/DesignApprovalModal.tsx` (created)
- `src/app/api/design-requests/[id]/approve/route.ts` (created)
- `src/app/mi-equipo/[slug]/page.tsx` (added approve button)
- `src/types/payments.ts` (fixed formatCLP function)
- `src/lib/mercadopago.ts` (fixed payment amounts)
- `src/app/mi-equipo/[slug]/payments/page.tsx` (player payment section)

#### **Manager Approval Flow**:

1. **Manager clicks "Approve Design"**
   - Reviews votes (optional - manager has final say)
   - Confirms approval

2. **System asks about payment mode** (can skip if already set in team settings)
   ```
   Modal: "How will this order be paid?"
   ‚óã Each player pays individually (use team default)
   ‚óã I will pay for the entire team
   ‚ñ° Save as team default
   ```

3. **Status changes to `approved`**

4. **System automatically creates**:
   - 1 `order` record
   - Multiple `order_items` (one per every current team member)
   - Links `design_request.order_id` to new order

**Order Creation Logic**:
```typescript
// Triggered when manager approves
async function createOrderFromDesignRequest(designRequestId: string, paymentMode: string) {
  const designRequest = await getDesignRequest(designRequestId);
  const teamMembers = await getTeamMembers(designRequest.team_id);

  // 1. Create order
  const order = await createOrder({
    team_id: designRequest.team_id,
    user_id: designRequest.requested_by,
    customer_id: designRequest.requested_by,
    status: 'pending',
    payment_status: 'unpaid',
    payment_mode: paymentMode,  // NEW: 'individual' or 'manager_pays_all'
    total_amount_cents: calculateTotal(teamMembers.length, productPrice),
    notes: `Order from design request: ${designRequest.product_name}`
  });

  // 2. Create order_items for ALL team members
  for (const member of teamMembers) {
    await createOrderItem({
      order_id: order.id,
      user_id: member.user_id,
      product_id: designRequest.product_id,
      design_id: designRequest.design_id,
      quantity: 1,
      price_cents: productPrice,
      customization: {
        player_name: null,  // To be filled by player
        player_number: null,
        size: null,
        opted_out: false     // NEW: Tracks opt-out status
      }
    });
  }

  // 3. Link design request to order
  await updateDesignRequest(designRequestId, {
    status: 'approved',
    order_id: order.id
  });

  // 4. Notify all team members
  await notifyTeamMembers(designRequest.team_id, {
    message: "New order created! Please confirm your information and complete payment.",
    link: `/mi-equipo/${team.slug}/payments`
  });
}
```

## **PHASE C: PAYMENT SYSTEM FINALIZATION** üí≥ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Status**: 90% complete, needs simplification and wiring to frontend

### üéØ PAYMENT ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLE

**KEEP IT SIMPLE**: Every payment to Mercado Pago is just a one-time payment. We handle ALL complexity internally.

**From Payment Processor Perspective**:
- Every checkout = Simple payment of $X CLP
- No splits, no bulk complexity on their end
- Just: "Process this payment amount"

**From Deserve Internal Perspective**:
- Use `payment_contributions` table for ALL payments
- Whether manager pays full order OR player pays their share = both are just contributions
- Order is "paid" when: `SUM(contributions.amount_cents WHERE status='approved') >= order.total_amount_cents`

**Simplified Flow**:
```
Manager clicks "Pay Full Order ($50,000)":
  ‚Üí Create payment_contribution(user_id=manager, amount_cents=50000, order_id=X)
  ‚Üí Create MP preference for $50,000
  ‚Üí Redirect to MP checkout
  ‚Üí Webhook marks contribution as "approved"
  ‚Üí Order status becomes "paid"

Player clicks "Pay My Share ($5,000)":
  ‚Üí Create payment_contribution(user_id=player, amount_cents=5000, order_id=X)
  ‚Üí Create MP preference for $5,000
  ‚Üí Redirect to MP checkout
  ‚Üí Webhook marks contribution as "approved"
  ‚Üí Order checks if fully paid, updates status if yes
```

**Benefits**:
- Single table handles all payment types
- No junction tables needed
- Simple webhook logic
- Easy to query: "Show all my payments"
- Flexible: Any user can contribute any amount

**Implementation Notes**:
- Remove `bulk_payments` table (unnecessary complexity)
- Remove `bulk_payment_orders` junction table
- Keep `payment_contributions` as single source of truth
- Add `payment_type` field: 'full' | 'split' | 'partial' (for analytics only)

### C.1: Payment Environment Variables

**Required**:
- [ ] `MERCADOPAGO_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Production token
- [ ] `MERCADOPAGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - For signature verification

## üß™ TESTING STRATEGY

### Critical User Paths

**Path 1: Small Team Flow**
1. Manager creates team
2. Manager browses catalog (new product-first flow)
3. Manager selects design
4. Manager collects player info via link
5. Players submit info anonymously
6. Players pay individual shares
7. Manager approves design
8. Order placed

**Path 2: Institution Flow**
1. Athletic Director creates organization
2. Creates multiple teams across sports
3. Browses designs across all sports
4. Sees same design on soccer and basketball
5. Orders both with bulk payment
6. Tracks all team orders in one view

**Path 3: Admin Content Management**
1. Admin configures products (one-time)
2. Admin creates new design
3. Uploads soccer jersey mockup
4. Design appears in soccer catalog
5. Later: adds basketball mockup
6. Design now appears in basketball catalog

## üè´ PHASE E: INSTITUTION TEAM MANAGEMENT (IN PROGRESS)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Database Setup Complete - üìù API & UI Development Ready to Begin

**Migration Completed**: 2025-10-12

**Reference Documents**:
- `INSTITUTION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (original plan)
- `INSTITUTION_IMPLEMENTATION_REFINEMENTS.md` (refined with codebase analysis)
- `DATABASE_SCHEMA_ANALYSIS.md` (production schema validation)
- `SMALL_TEAM_ANALYSIS_FOR_INSTITUTION.md` (reusable components)

**Timeline**: 20 days (9 phases)

### Overview

Expand platform to support **Athletic Directors and Sports Coordinators** managing large institutions with multiple sports programs and teams.

**Key Differentiators from Small Teams**:
- **Multi-sport program management** (not single team)
- **Centralized Athletic Director control** (not collaborative democracy)
- **Nested hierarchy**: Institution ‚Üí Programs ‚Üí Sub-Teams ‚Üí Player Roster Data
- **Players are roster data ONLY** (no user accounts for players)
- **Administrative staff only** (Athletic Director, Coach, Assistant)
- **Budget tracking** across programs
- **Bulk operations** (CSV import for 500+ roster entries)

### Target Users

**Who Gets User Accounts:**
- Athletic Directors (full control)
- Program Coordinators/Assistants (data entry, communication, progress tracking)
- Head Coaches (sub-team roster management)

**Who Does NOT Get User Accounts:**
- Players (managed as roster data only)

### Architecture Highlights

**‚úÖ Database Tables Created** (2025-10-12):
- ‚úÖ `institution_sub_teams` - Sub-teams within institution (Varsity Soccer, JV Basketball, etc.)
- ‚úÖ `institution_sub_team_members` - Player roster data (names, sizes, positions - NO user accounts)

**‚úÖ Modified Tables** (4):
- ‚úÖ `team_memberships` - Added `institution_role` (athletic_director, program_coordinator, head_coach, assistant)
- ‚úÖ `orders` - Added `sub_team_id` (links order to specific sub-team)
- ‚úÖ `design_requests` - Added `sub_team_id` (links design request to sub-team)
- ‚úÖ `team_settings` - Added 5 institution settings (autonomy, approval requirements, budget tracking)

**‚úÖ Security & Functions**:
- ‚úÖ 9 RLS policies created (role-based access control)
- ‚úÖ 2 helper functions (`get_institution_sub_teams`, `has_institution_role`)

**Infrastructure Ready**:
- ‚úÖ `teams.team_type` already supports 'institution'
- ‚úÖ Payment system requires no changes (payment_contributions, bulk_payments tables ready)
- ‚úÖ 20+ reusable UI components identified from small team implementation

### Key Features

- User documentation

### Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate**: % of new teams created as institutions vs. small teams
- **Program Count**: Average programs per institution (target: 5-8)
- **Member Count**: Average roster entries per institution (target: 100-300)
- **Time Savings**: Time to create order for 50 members (target: <5 minutes with bulk import)
- **Budget Accuracy**: % of institutions that stay within allocated budgets (target: >90%)

### Technical Considerations

1. **Performance**: Optimize for 500+ roster entries, 100+ orders
2. **Data Migration**: Additive only (no breaking changes to small teams)
3. **Component Reuse**: Leverage existing components with role-based rendering
4. **Payment Model**: Institution pays all (no individual player payments)
5. **CSV Import**: Roster data only (no user invitations)

### Open Questions

1. **Payment Model**: Institutional payment only vs. hybrid model?
   - **Recommendation**: Start with institutional payment only (MVP)

2. **Sub-Team Requirement**: Required or optional?
   - **Recommendation**: Optional (some programs may not need sub-teams)

3. **Ownership Transfer**: Can Athletic Director transfer ownership?
   - **Recommendation**: Yes, transfer entire institution (use existing system)

4. **Cross-Sport Design Reuse**: Can designs be shared across sports?
   - **Recommendation**: Yes, allow Athletic Director to create institution-wide designs

### Next Steps After Current Sprint

1. Review and approve institution implementation plan
2. Begin Phase 1: Database schema design
3. Create API specification documents
4. Set up development environment for institution features
5. Schedule design review for institution dashboard UI mockups
